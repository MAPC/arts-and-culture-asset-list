Reach Sculpture,320 Centre Street; 42.322184 -71.104331,"""Reach"" is composed of five 8”x 8” stainless steel square tubes and creates the form of a 25-foot monumental hand. The sculpture symbolizes the immigrant experience of reaching up to climb the ladder of success in America. The form of a hand is only visible from the central axis of the park. From all other vantage points, the sculpture appears abstract. Each upright of the sculpture has two engraved quotations at eye level. The quotations were written by youth who live in the Hyde Square neighborhood and describe their, or their family’s, experiences as immigrants in America. The joints of the contorted uprights are purposely left exposed to symbolize the different turning points or changes in the life of an American immigrant.",2011,https://www.vamonde.com/posts/jamaica-plain-reaches-for-more/1077
